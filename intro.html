<h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><BR><div id="bold"><h2>JavaScript</h2> </div>– is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
<br>
    <ul>
    <li><div id="bold">Client-side</div>– It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.</li>
    <li><div id="bold">Server-side</div> – It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.</li>
    <br><li><div id="bold">Imperative language </div>– In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It simply control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call.</li>
    <li><div id="bold">Declarative programming </div>– In this type of language we are concern about how it is to be done , basically here logical computation require . Here  main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it like  arrow function do .</li>
</ul>
<br>
<div id="bold">JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:</div><br>
<ul>
    <li><div id="bold">Internal JavaScript</div> We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the < script > tag. The < script > tag can either be placed inside the < head > or the < body > tag according to the requirement.</li>
    <li><div id="bold">External JavaScript</div> We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension.js and then link this file inside the < head > tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.</li>
</ul>

<button type="submit" class="button">Home</button>
